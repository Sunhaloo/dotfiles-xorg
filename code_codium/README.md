>[!NOTE]
>I normally use Neovim and pretty much stays in the terminal for most things.
>But I do use VS Codium from time to time.
>
>Hence, this will basically stay as an "*work-in-progress*" and will always be incomplete
>
>>Nevertheless, if I do add something to it; I will update it!
>
>>Additionally, as VS Code it the standard code editor for most applications / companies;
>>There are plenty of tutorials online on how to configure it!
